# Word-Cloud
For this project, I am creating a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script processes the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculated frequencies. The word cloud module will then generate the image from the dictionary.
